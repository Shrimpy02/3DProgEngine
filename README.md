# When downloading and building project you must rebuild cmake to get the correct directories for the project
	# Or rename all inncorrect directories in the (out/build/x64-debug/) CMakeCache.txt file.
	# Additionally there is a known issue where github does not include assimps (libs/assimp/code/AssetLib/Obj) Obj file. Might have fixed it now?
